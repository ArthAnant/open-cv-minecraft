Technologies used: - 
             
             • Python 3.9.0: -
             Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming 
             language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use 
             of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its objectoriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for 
             small and large-scale projects.
             
             • Ursina engine 3.1.0: -
             The Ursina Engine is a recently released open-source Python based 3D 
             game engine. The Ursina Engine is built on top of the well-established 
             Panda3D game engine. The Ursina Engine is available for Windows, Mac and Linux with the source code available on GitHub under the MIT license. 
             To get started with the Ursina Engine you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed as well as the pip package manger and git.
             
             • OpenCV: -
             OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming 
             functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was 
             later acquired by Intel). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. Starting with 2011, OpenCV features 
             GPU acceleration for real-time operations.
            

Features: -

            • Play the game using mouse and keyboard.
            
            • Build any structures we desire with the help of 4 distinct blocks 
              that you c an choose by pressing the 1,2,3,4 keys.
            
            • Build using the left mouse button.
            
            • A new block is added when we press the left mouse button 
              normal to the block that’s at the center of our screen.
            
            • Remove blocks using the right mouse button and doing so to the 
              first defined layer of blocks leaves a void in the plane.
            
            • A sound plays whenever we add or remove a block.
            
            • Play the same game using hand gestures with the camera 
              controller.
            
            • We have to move our hands in such a way in front of the camera 
              that the index finger touches the buttons made in the OpenCV window.
            
            • If we touch the “^” button, the player character moves forward or 
              if we press “w” on the keyboard.
            
            • If we touch the “v” button the player character moves backwards 
              or if we press ”s” on the keyboard.
            
            • If we touch the “<” button the player character moves towards 
              left side or if we press “a” on the keyboard.
            
            • If we touch the “>” button the player character moves towards 
              right side or if we press ”d” on the keyboard.
